# Day 23 Rubric Checklist

Repo URL: https://github.com/tuandung1625/Day23-Track2-Observability-Lab

Generated on: 2026-06-29

## Automated gate

`python scripts/verify.py` passed:

```text
Result: 12/12 checks passed
```

`make verify` could not be executed on this Windows host because `make` is not installed in PATH. The Makefile target calls `python3 scripts/verify.py`, so the equivalent rubric gate was executed directly.

## Remaining manual action

To claim rubric item #11, replace the placeholder in `.env`:

```env
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
```

Then restart Alertmanager and rerun the alert demo:

```bash
docker compose restart alertmanager
make alert
```

Capture Slack fire + resolve screenshots as:
